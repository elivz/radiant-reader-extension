        We have sent a message to 
        %strong
          = current_reader.email
        containing a link that will automatically activate your account and log you in. If you can't find the message, we can 
        = link_to("send it again", new_reader_activation_url) + '.'
      - else
        You should have received a message 
        containing a link that will automatically activate your account and log you in. If you can't find the message, we can 
        = link_to("send it again", new_password_reset_url) + ':'
        just put your email address in the password reminder form, and if your account has not been activated you'll receive another activation message.

        If you think you might have put the wrong email address in, the easiest thing to do is 
        = link_to 'register again', new_reader_url
        with the right one. The failed registration attempt will be purged after a couple of days.
