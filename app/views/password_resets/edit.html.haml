      Thank you for persevering with the authorization process.

      Please enter and confirm the new password you would like to use. It must be at least four characters long, nothing obvious or typical and ideally a mixture of numbers and letters.

        Your password hasn't changed yet, so if you've just remembered it you can still
        = link_to "log in.", reader_login_url

      - content_for :pagetitle do
        Change my password

  - else 

    %p.haserror
      Sorry: the system can't find you. That link must have been garbled somewhere along the line. 
      Please paste the 20-character confirmation code into the box below and we'll try again.

      The confirmation code only works for ten minutes, but you can always 
      = link_to "enter your email address again", new_password_reset_url
      and we'll send a new one.
